###Perfomance
    - Startup-time (
        how long does it take to "see something" on the screen,
        How quickly is a user able to interact with the page
    )
    
    - Runtime perfomance(
        How smooth does the application run
        How smooth do animations play
        memory leaks
       )
       
##What influences performance?
    - Startup-time (browser-side) (
        How fast does the javascript load (and execute)
        )   
    
    - Runtime (all side) (
        How much "work" does the script do
        How much memory is occupied
        )
